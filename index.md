## About me

I am currently looking for full time work having just completed an MSc in Urban Informatics at King's College London. I used to work as a transport and cities economist at the engineering consultancy Ove Arup & Partners. Prior to that, I did a gap year in South America where I worked as a volunteer English teacher in Chile and also did short term work in two hostels in Rio and a bar in La Paz Bolivia. Other experience I gained before this includes a year long placement at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and a summer internship at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

# Follow me
I occassionally Tweet [@tolliam](https://twitter.com/tolliam), but more frequently retweet.
It's perhaps more interesting to follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1072098) where you can see all the places I run, swim and cycle.
