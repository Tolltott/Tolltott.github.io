# Academic writing style

As a dyslexic (or at least towards that end of the spectrum), I've always found writing a struggle. In a world where the standard of your writing is still seen by some as a proxy for intelligence, this has been a source of immense insecurity for me. I often know what I want to say, but I often struggle to place the right words in the appropriate order to make my point. I go around in circles thinking about word order and before I know it, I've spent quite a long time agonising over what feels like such a trivial task. Writing in an academic setting can be particularly challenging.

## The passive voice

One of the only things that sticks in my mind from my secondary school English lessons is to avoid the use of I (first person) in essays. However, what I didn't appreciate until recently is that the the inevitable consequence of this is frequent use of the passive construction. 

The passive can sound "clumsy", "cumbersome", "pompous" and even "lazy" as it describes the action without saying who did it. Its use can also lead to ambiguity and exaserbates the risk of dangling modifiers. Take the following example.

`Before undertaking linear regression, it was determined that the data needed cleaning.`

Another problem with the passive is that it results in "anthromorpholgism" that is making objects do things which only humans can. Take the following example. 

`The study explored the use of fertilisers on crops`. 

Studies themselves are not conscious and cannot themselves explore anything, nor for that matter can an article discuss...
`The article discussed the issue of political polorisation.`

While use of the passive is frowned upon in humanities subjects, it is used all of the time in the scientific world due to it being an easy way to give the impression of "objectivity". The passive is also useful where the person doing the action is irrelevant or unknown. 

## Too many nouns

A seperate but related issue to the passive is the practice of using more nouns than verbs. Take the following example. 

'These girls have the intention of joining the netball team.`

This would read much better as:

'These girls intend to join the netball team.`
