# Spatial Autocorrelation and autoregressive models


Positive spatial autocorrelation occurs where average and aggregated attributes of one area are of a similar value to their neighbours. Negative spatial autocorrelation occures where average and aggregated attributes of one area are inversely related to their neighbours. 

Spatial autocorrelation can be measured by calculating Moran's I.

We can model autocorrelation through use of spatial autoregressive models. These take two forms. Firstly spatial lag models. These implicity assume that there is some kind of difussion going on, such as the spread of an infectious disease. While spatial error models instead assume there are omitted variables that are spatial correted.
