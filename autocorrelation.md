# Spatial Autocorrelation and autoregressive models


Positive spatial autocorrelation refers to the idea that the average and aggregated attributes of one area are of a similar value to their neighbours with negative spatial autocorrelation simply the inverse of this. 

We can use mdoel autocorrelation in regression through use of spatial autoregressive models. These take two forms. Firstly spatial lag models. These implicity assume that there is some kind of difussion going on, such as the spread of an infectious disease. While spatial error models instead assume there are omitted variables that are spatial correted.
