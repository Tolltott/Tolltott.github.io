## Major projects - what happened next?

Two years working in a multidisciplinary consultancy gave me exposure to more projects than I can actually remember. Given such large projects don't happen overnight, none of those I worked on have yet are near completion although it has been nice to see in the news some significant milestones being reached.

### Cardiff Parkway  

Cardiff Parkway is a proposed new railway station that is [due to go through the consenting phase this summer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46967369).  

### Global Centre of Rail Excellence in Wales  

This is a major ambitious project to build a train test facility in Wales and it [recently secured the agreement of the local authority for further progression](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/global-centre-rail-excellence-takes-16222717).  

### Temple Quarter Campus  

The Temple Quarter Campus represents a major expansion for the University of Bristol and site preparaotry works, including the demolition of the Old Post Office sorting site is [well underway](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/30/demolition-of-bristol-eyesore-makes-way-for-university-campus-temple-quarter).
