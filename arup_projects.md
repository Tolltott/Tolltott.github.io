## Major projects - what happened next?

Two years working in a multidisciplinary consultancy gave me exposure to more projects than I can actually remember. Given such large projects don't happen overnight, none of those I worked on have yet are near completion although significant milestones being reached on some. Of course, not all schemes are ultimately taken forward, and this can be for a variety of reasons.

### Cardiff Parkway  

Cardiff Parkway is a proposed new railway station that is [due to go through the consenting phase this summer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46967369).  

### The Global Centre of Rail Excellence in Wales  

This is a ambitious project to build a train testing facility in Wales and it [recently secured the agreement of the local authority for further progression](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/global-centre-rail-excellence-takes-16222717).  

### Temple Quarter Campus  

The Temple Quarter Campus represents a major expansion for the University of Bristol and site preparaotry works are well underway, [including the demolition of the Old Post Office sorting site is](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/30/demolition-of-bristol-eyesore-makes-way-for-university-campus-temple-quarter).  

### M4 Corridor around Newport

This scheme was proposed for many years as a way to relieve congestion on a busy 2-lane section of the M4 motorway around Newport that was prone to congestion. I worked on behalf of the design team providing evidence to the Public Local Inquiry on the economic costs and benefits of the scheme. Although the Inspector reccomended the scheme proceed, the government took the decision to [cancel it on cost and environmental grounds](https://gov.wales/m4-corridor-around-newport-overview).
