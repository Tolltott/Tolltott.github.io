# Spatial data challenges

## Ecological falacy

False assumption that variables at the aggregates level share the same relationship at the individual level.

##Â Simpson's paradox 

Trends can reverse when different groups combine due to different sizes. Examples include American Civil Rights vote/US states and comparing drug effectiveness over multiple days

## Modifiable Ariel Unit Problem (MAUP)

Boundaries are often arbitrary and changing the location (zone effect) or size (distance effect) of these can effect measurement.

# Edege effects

Events often lie just beyond the boundary and so if these are excluded those areas at the edge of the study area may in some way have their values understated in distance, density or interpolation analysis.
