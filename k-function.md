## Ripley's K function

Ripley's k function builds on the nearest neighbourhoods method but the key difference is that it considers multiple neighbours. Specifically it counts the number of neighbors within multiple distance bands from each event/point. The average number of points for each distance band is calculated with these values standardized by dividing by the density of points within the whole area.
